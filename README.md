# Intelligent Traffic Flow Prediction System
## Objectives
1. Predict traffic flow and congestion in real-time using historical data.
2. Use advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTM, GRU) for time series forecasting.
3. Visualize traffic predictions and historical data trends for better decision-making.
